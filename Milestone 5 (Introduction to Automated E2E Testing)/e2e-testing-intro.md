# Introduction to Automated E2E Testing

## What Are Automated E2E Tests & Why Do We Need Them?

### Reflections

**What is the difference between E2E, unit, and integration testing?**

Unit tests check individual components, integration tests check how components work together, and E2E tests validate the entire system from the userâ€™s perspective.

**What are the key benefits of E2E tests in a real-world application?**

E2E tests catch bugs that other tests might miss, confirm works as expected for users, and reduce the need for manual testing.

**How does automated testing help Focus Bear reduce regression bugs?**

Automated tests quickly detect issues after updates, preventing old bugs from reappearing and keeping the app stable.

**What are some challenges of writing and maintaining E2E tests?**

They can be slow, require frequent updates when the UI changes, and may sometimes fail due to minor differences in test environments.
