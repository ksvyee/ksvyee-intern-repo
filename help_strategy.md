# Debugging/Troubleshooting Tests

## When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?

### Reflection

**When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?**

I use AI when I need a quick, direct answer or explanation without digging through multiple sources. AI is helpful for summarizing concepts, debugging code, or generating templates. I use Google when I need official documentation, troubleshooting forum discussions, or the latest updates on a specific topic.

**How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?**

I ask a colleague when the problem is complex, specific to our project, or requires team input. If I’ve tried AI and Google but still don’t understand or need clarification, talking to a colleague is the best option.

**What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?**

Developers can struggle with unclear error messages, outdated information, or missing context about how a system works. Without guidance, it's easy to waste time on trial and error. Asking for help at the right time can speed up problem-solving and prevent frustration.
