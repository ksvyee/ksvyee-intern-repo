## Working with Vulnerable Populations

### Reflections
**How can you adjust your communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?**

I can adjust my communication style to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates by using clear, simple, and direct language. I will avoid vague instructions and ensure my messages are well-structured and easy to follow.

**What are some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?**

Some common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive include overly complex interfaces, unclear navigation, and overwhelming amounts of information presented at once. 

**What is one practical change you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?**

One practical change I can make in my work to better support vulnerable populations is to prioritize accessibility in digital content by ensuring that information is presented in a way that is easy to understand and process. Additionally, I can be more mindful of different communication preferences and adapt accordingly.
