## Data Privacy & Confidentiality

### Reflections
**What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?**

I will always use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication. I will only access data on secure devices and networks and avoid sharing sensitive information over public Wi-Fi. I will also double-check before sharing any data to make sure it's going to the right person and is necessary to share.

**How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?**

I will keep files in encrypted storage and avoid saving them on personal devices. When sharing, I will use secure channels like encrypted emails or company-approved tools. If I need to delete sensitive data, I will permanently erase it instead of just moving it to the trash.

**What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?**

Some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues include using weak passwords, falling for phishing scams, and sharing data with unauthorized people. These can be avoided by using a password manager, being careful with emails and links, and always following security guidelines before accessing or sending sensitive information.
