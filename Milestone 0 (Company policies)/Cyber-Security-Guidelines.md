## Cyber Security #1

### Reflections
**What security measures do you currently follow, and where can you improve?**

Currently, I follow some security measures, like using strong passwords, keeping my software updated and using a password manager. However, I can improve by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) on all my accounts. I also need to be more careful about recognizing phishing emails and suspicious links.

**How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?**

To make secure behavior a habit rather than an afterthought, I will always double-check links before clicking, lock my computer whenever I step away, and stay informed about the latest cyber security threats. I can also regularly review the activity of each account to detect any unusual or unauthorized access.

**What steps will you take to ensure your passwords and accounts are secure?**

To ensure my passwords and accounts are secure, I will use a password manager to store and generate strong passwords. I will enable 2FA on all important accounts and avoid using the same password for multiple logins. Additionally, I will regularly check my account activity for any signs of unauthorized access.

**What would you do if you suspected a security breach or suspicious activity on your account?**

If I suspected a security breach or noticed suspicious activity on my account, I would immediately change my password and enable 2FA if it wasnâ€™t already on. I would also check my recent login history for any unusual access and report the issue. If necessary, I would temporarily lock or deactivate my account to prevent further damage.

### New Cyber Security Habit 
*I will regularly review my account activity and report any suspicious login attempts immediately.*
