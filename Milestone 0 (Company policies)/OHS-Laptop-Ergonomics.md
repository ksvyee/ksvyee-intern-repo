## Occupational Health & Safety (OHS) for Desk-Based Work

### Reflections
**What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup?**

I can start using an external monitor to keep my screen at eye level and prevent neck strain.

**What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain?**

I will sit upright with my back supported, keep my screen at the right height, and take movement breaks. I will also try to stretch regularly, do quick posture checks, and avoid slouching.

**How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day?**

To remind myself, I can use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks throughout the day. Additionally, Iâ€™ll create a habit of standing up and moving around during breaks to avoid stiffness.
