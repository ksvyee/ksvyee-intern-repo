# Introduction to Automated E2E Testing

## Setting Up WinAppDriver & Running Your First Test

### Reflections

**How does WinAppDriver interact with Windows applications?**

WinAppDriver acts as a bridge between Appium and Windows applications by using Microsoftâ€™s UI Automation framework. It listens for automation requests and translates them into actions like clicking buttons, entering text, or reading UI properties.

**What are the key steps to setting up an Appium test for Windows?**

First, install and run WinAppDriver. Then, set up an Appium test project by installing Appium and the required dependencies. Next, write a test script defining the desired capabilities. Finally, run the test and verify that it executes successfully.

**How do you identify UI elements for automation?**

We use tools like Inspect.exe to examine UI elements. These tools provide important properties.

**What challenges might arise when automating a Windows app with Appium?**

Some challenges include dynamic element IDs, which make it hard to find elements consistently, and applications built with other frameworks, which may not be fully supported.
