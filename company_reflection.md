## Understanding of Focus Bear's Mission and Vision

### Reflections

**Why do you think Focus Bear was created?**

I think Focus Bear was made to help people, especially those with ADHD and ASD, stay focused and avoid burnout. Regular productivity apps don’t always work well for neurodivergent people, so Focus Bear was created to fill that gap.

**What problem is Focus Bear solving?**

It helps people avoid distractions and burnout by giving them tools to stay on track, take breaks, and build good habits. It’s made for people who struggle with focus and need a system that actually works for them.

**Why do you think this mission is important?**

A lot of people have trouble staying focused, and most apps don’t really help them. Focus Bear is important because it’s built for people who need extra support, so they can be productive without feeling overwhelmed.

**How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?**

I like that Focus Bear is all about helping people improve their focus and well-being. I’m interested in tech that makes life easier, so I think what they’re doing is really cool.

**Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?**

Yeah, I’ve had moments where I struggle with distractions and staying on task. Even though I don’t have ADHD or ASD, I can see how Focus Bear’s tools would help me be more productive and build better routines.

***Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?***

Yes, I know someone in university who always procrastinates when it comes to studying. They don’t have ADHD or autism, but they struggle with time management and usually put off studying until the last minute. Instead of starting early, they spend their time playing games, and by the time they finally begin studying, it’s already midnight. This leads to them staying up all night cramming for an exam the next morning or barely getting any sleep, which leaves them exhausted and unable to focus properly during the test. They also tend to ask others what to study or what the exam coverage is at the last minute because they weren’t able to plan ahead or stay organized. Since they don’t have a proper study schedule or anything to keep them on track, they get overwhelmed and struggle to retain information.

I think Focus Bear could really help them build better study habits, stay organized, and manage their time more effectively so they can avoid last-minute cramming and actually get enough rest before an exam. It can also help by blocking distractions and encouraging them to focus on their tasks instead of wasting time.
