# Learn about Focus Bear and Set your Goals

## Try out the Focus Bear app

### Reflections

**What was your first impression of the app?**

It looks simple and minimalist.

**Did you find anything difficult to understand?**

I got a bit confused while navigating the Windows app. Some functions weren’t immediately clear, and I wasn’t sure what certain buttons or features did.

**If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?**

It’s an app that helps you stay focused by blocking distractions and reminding you to stick to your tasks.

**What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?**

The UI/UX could be more intuitive. It would help to have clearer labels, a short guided walkthrough when opening the app for the first time, or tooltips that explain features when hovering over them.
