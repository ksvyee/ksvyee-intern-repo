## Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration 

### Reflections
**How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?**

Ensuring that everyone on the team stays updated on progress, blockers, and priorities. Daily stand-ups provide quick updates, retrospectives help improve workflows, backlog refinement ensures clarity on tasks, and sprint planning or continuous prioritization keeps work organized.

**Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?**

For my role as an Automated QA, I think backlog refinement is the most important ceremony. This is where tasks are clarified, prioritized, and properly defined, ensuring I have all the necessary details to create and run automated tests efficiently.
