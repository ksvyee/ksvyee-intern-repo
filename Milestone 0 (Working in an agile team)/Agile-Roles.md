## Roles in an Agile Team

### Reflections
**What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?**

As an Automated QA Tester, my role in the Agile process is to ensure that software is reliable, functional, and meets quality standards before release. I contribute by writing and maintaining automated test scripts, identifying bugs early, and providing quick feedback to developers.

**How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?**

My responsibilities overlap with developers since I test their code and report any defects. I also collaborate with the Product Manager to understand requirements and ensure features meet user needs. Additionally, I work with the Agile PM to prioritize testing efforts and maintain smooth workflows.
