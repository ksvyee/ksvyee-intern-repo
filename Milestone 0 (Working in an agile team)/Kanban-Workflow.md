## Agile Workflows & Kanban

### Reflections
**How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?**

Kanban helps manage priorities and avoid overload by providing a clear visual representation of tasks and their progress. Using work-in-progress (WIP) limits, Kanban prevents teams from taking on too many tasks at once.

**How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?**

I can improve my workflow using Kanban principles by keeping my tasks updated, following WIP limits, and focusing on completing tasks before starting new ones.
