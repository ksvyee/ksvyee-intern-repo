# Learn about Focus Bear and Set your Goals

## Merge Conflicts & Conflict Resolution

### Experience

**What caused the conflict?**

The conflict happened in the README.md file because I made changes to the same part of the file in both the main branch and the conflict-branch. When I tried to merge them, Git didnâ€™t know which version to keep.

**How did you resolve it?**

I accepted the current change, so the final version of README.md kept the content from the main branch while also including the change from conflict-branch.

**What did you learn?**

I learned how merge conflicts happen when different branches edit the same file. I also learned how to use GitHub Desktop to detect and resolve conflicts and how to edit files manually in VS Code when needed.
