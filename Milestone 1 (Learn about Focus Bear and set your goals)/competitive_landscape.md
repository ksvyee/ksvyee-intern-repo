## Understand Competitive Landscape

### Reflections

**What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?**

Focus Bear isn’t just about blocking distractions, it also helps build good habits and keeps you on track with routines. Other apps might help with focus, but Focus Bear feels more like a guide that reminds you what to do next, not just what to avoid.

**If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?**

I’d choose Focus Bear because it doesn’t just stop distractions, it helps with time management too. It makes sure I follow my routine instead of just blocking apps and websites.

**What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?**

Some apps, like Tiimo, let you customize your schedule more freely. Focus Bear has structured routines, but sometimes people might want more flexibility in setting things up.

**Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?**

I think Focus Bear could improve by giving users more control over their schedules. Some people might need to adjust things throughout the day, so adding more flexibility would be helpful.
