## Set up a Terminal Client 

### Reflection

**Which terminal client did you choose? Why?**

I chose Windows Terminal because it’s built into Windows and supports multiple shells like CMD and PowerShell. It’s easy to use and works well for basic commands.

**What customizations (if any) did you make?**

Not much because I like the way it is. I just explored the settings a bit and adjusted the font size for better readability.

**What was the most useful command you learned today?**

The cd command was really useful for navigating through folders in the terminal. It makes moving between directories faster without using the file explorer.
