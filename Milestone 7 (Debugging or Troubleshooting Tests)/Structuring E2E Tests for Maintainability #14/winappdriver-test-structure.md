## Structuring E2E Tests for Maintainability

### Reflections

**What are the key principles of maintainable E2E test code?**

Good E2E test code should be modular, reusable, and easy to understand. It should separate test logic from UI interactions, avoid duplication, and use clear naming conventions.

**How does the Page Object Model (POM) improve test readability?**

The POM keeps UI interactions in one place, making tests cleaner and easier to read. Instead of directly writing element locators in tests, POM uses methods, making updates easier when the UI changes.

**Why should repetitive actions (like login steps) be moved to reusable helpers?**

Repetitive actions like logins should be in helper functions to reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and speed up test creation. This way, if something changes, you only update one function instead of multiple test files.

**How can a well-structured test suite speed up debugging and test writing?**

A well-structured test suite makes it easier to find issues, fix bugs, and add new tests. When tests are organized, you donâ€™t waste time searching for failures or rewriting the same steps. Debugging becomes faster, and writing new tests is more efficient.
