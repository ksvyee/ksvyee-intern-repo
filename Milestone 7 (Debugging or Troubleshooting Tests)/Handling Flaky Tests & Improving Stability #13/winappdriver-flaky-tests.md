## Handling Flaky Tests & Improving Stability

### Reflections

**What are the most common causes of flaky tests in WinAppDriver?**

Flaky tests in WinAppDriver are often caused by timing issues, where elements take time to appear or become interactable. Other common causes include race conditions, slow application loading, UI transitions, and inconsistent system performance.

**How do implicit waits help prevent timing-related test failures?**

Implicit waits help prevent timing-related failures by making WinAppDriver wait for a specified time before throwing an error if an element is not found.

**When should explicit waits be used instead of implicit waits?**

Explicit waits should be used instead of implicit waits when waiting for a specific condition, such as an element being visible, clickable, or containing text. Unlike implicit waits, explicit waits apply only to the targeted element and help optimize test execution by not forcing all element lookups to wait unnecessarily.

**How does retry logic help with test stability, and when should it be avoided?**

Retry logic improves test stability by allowing the test to attempt an action multiple times before failing. However, it should be avoided if it masks real bugs or leads to excessive test execution times, hiding actual application problems.

**What strategies can prevent flaky tests in large test suites?**

To prevent flaky tests in large test suites, use a combination of stable locators, proper synchronization with waits, and avoid hardcoded sleep statements. Keeping tests modular and isolated from dependencies also reduces flakiness.
