## Git Concepts: Staging vs. Committing

### Summary

**What is the difference between staging and committing?**

Staging is like setting changes aside before saving them. It prepares files for the next commit but doesn’t store them permanently. Committing takes a snapshot of the staged files and saves them in Git’s history, making the changes official.

**Why does Git separate these two steps?**

Git separates staging and committing to give you more control over what gets saved. This allows you to organize your changes, commit only specific files instead of everything at once, and review your work before making a permanent record.

**When would you want to stage changes without committing?**

You might stage changes without committing when working on multiple files but only want to commit some, when saving progress but aren’t ready to finalize, or when reviewing edits before making a structured commit.
