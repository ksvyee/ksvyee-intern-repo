## Debugging & Handling Common Test Failures

### Reflections

**What are the most common reasons for E2E test failures?**

E2E tests often fail due to timing issues, incorrect element locators, dynamic UI changes, or WebView loading delays. Network issues, app crashes, or missing permissions can also cause failures.

**How do you determine if a test is flaky?**

A test is flaky if it sometimes passes and sometimes fails without code changes. Running it multiple times can help confirm if failures are random or caused by unstable conditions like slow loading elements.

**What strategies can you use to improve test reliability?**

Using explicit waits, retry logic, and stable element locators can make tests more reliable. Keeping tests independent and a consistent test environment also helps reduce flakiness.

**How can logging and screenshots help with debugging test failures?**

Logs show what happened before a failure, making it easier to spot issues. Screenshots capture the exact state of the app at failure points, helping identify missing elements or UI problems.
