## Set Up AI Tools for Development

### Experience

**Which AI tools did you try?**

I used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT.

**What worked well? What didnâ€™t?**

So far, both worked well. Copilot was helpful for code suggestions, while ChatGPT was great for explanations and debugging.

**When do you think AI is most useful for coding?**

AI is most useful for getting quick answers, generating code snippets, debugging, and understanding new concepts faster.
