## Set up Git Locally

### Reflection

**Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?**

Yes, Iâ€™ve used Git before for version control and mainly to track changes in my code and collaborate on group projects.

**Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?**

I use GitHub Desktop because it has a simple interface that makes it easier to manage branches and commits without using the command line all the time.

**What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?**

I learned about merge conflicts and how to resolve them, which was really useful. I also explored GitHub Desktop and saw how it makes managing repositories easier without always using the command line. Aside from that, I found Git shortcuts helpful for quickly switching branches and undoing commits.
