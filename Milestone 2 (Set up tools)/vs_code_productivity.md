### Reflection

**Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?**

I think Ctrl + P will be really useful because it makes switching between files faster. Also, Ctrl + / for commenting code quickly and Ctrl + ` for opening the terminal easily will save a lot of time.

**How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?**

Keyboard shortcuts help me work faster by reducing the time spent clicking around. Instead of searching for options in menus, I can do things instantly, which makes coding and debugging much smoother.
