## Set up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

### Reflection

**Which extensions did you install? Why?**

I installed Lighthouse and A JSON Viewer since they are somewhat closely related to my role.

**What was the most useful thing you learned?**

Lighthouse is really helpful for quickly spotting performance issues, and a JSON viewer makes API responses much clearer to analyze.
